## Use Case

Provides an image which add details or show a different view about a particular feature/area in the main content.

- You have a group picture with many people on it. The image quality doesn't allow to recognize all of them, so you annotate each face with the name of the person, and you add in the annotation an individual picture of that person.  
- You have a picture of an architect's plan for a building which is now built. You want to show, for the differents items on the plan, how it looks like once built. So you annotate some features (eg the patio) with an actual photo
- You have a manifest with a video showing an old building at the time of his creation. Sometimes when the video shows a different part of the building, you want to annotate the video with a photo of how this part looks now. Some annotations are just one image, but some also contains a description like "this wall faces north, you can see there is more moss there"

## Implementation Notes

Our supplementary image is not part of the Canvas content, thus it must not have the motivation `painting`, and so is to be placed in the `annotations` section of the Canvas. Following the [W3C Web Annotation model](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/#external-web-resources), we have a simple image body referencing our image, and a text body to provides a comment/title about the image.

## Example

The main content is a photo of a square in GÃ¶ttingen, which shows, among others things, a fountain. We wanted to show the lights on the fountain during the night, so we associated the part of the canvas containing the fountain with an Annotation consisting of a picture of the fountain at night and a text comment.
