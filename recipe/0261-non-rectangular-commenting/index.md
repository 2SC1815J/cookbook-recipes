## Use Case

For a IIIF resource, you would like to add a simple annotation to the resource, where the area of the resource you would like to highlight is not a rectangle. The shape of the focus area needs to be delineated with precision to highlight only the portion of the image that is relevant to the annotation.

## Implementation Notes

The [IIIF Presentation 3.0 API][prezi3] does not itself discuss non-rectangular annotations, incorporating them from the [W3C Web Annotation Data Model](http://w3.org/TR/annotation-model/) by reference. For a full description of this and other web annotations used in IIIF annotations, we recommend you read that document.

The W3C data model requires non-rectangular polygonal annotations to be described in the Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) markup format. Note that client parsing of SVG varies, and valid SVG may not display as you expect. SVGs have the potential to be highly complex, incorporating multiple `path` elements and/or `mask` elements; this example is highly simplified for the purpose of demonstrating an entry point into IIIF affordances.

When reviewing your SVG data, remove all styling and transformation features, per [the W3C data model](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/#svg-selector). To ensure your SVG markup is valid, you can use the [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/). SVG can be valid markup as absolute points in a coordinate space or as relative points along a path. 

Sizing and placement of the SVG polygon in relation to its `target` takes some special attention. If the `target` is the entire Canvas, then the SVG viewport is assumed to cover the entire Canvas. On the other hand, if the SVG's coordinates are mapped to a part of a Canvas, then its `target` must be the rectangular bounding box of the Canvas in which the SVG viewport should be placed. If the dimensions of the viewport and its target region (either the bounding box or the entire Canvas) are not the same, then the SVG must be scaled such that it covers the region. This may result in different scaling ratios for the X and Y dimensions.

### Additional Notes on SVG

Community feedback on the original version of this recipe led to conversations and thence to the decision to expand its discussion of SVG. If you have comments on this or any recipe, speak up in the `#cookbook` channel on the [IIIF Slack workspace](https://iiif.slack.com/).

SVG implementations and affordances occupy a large and complex space. Not all implementations have the same affordances, and not all features of SVG are present in all implementations. For example for a small example of SVG creation software, SVG paths exported from GIMP 2.10 on MacOS will set an origin at the upper left corner of a bounding box while one generated in Acorn 7 on MacOS will set the origin in the lower left corner. Conventional browser support is equally complex: All major browsers natively [provide basic support](https://caniuse.com/svg), though tiles don't scale properly in MS Edge and important details such as `img` vs `object` container support are not considered "basic", at least by this common matrix.

In view of this complexity, and acknowledging that requiring viewers to implement the full SVG specification on a `canvas` is impractical, this recipe suggests the following guidelines. As a baseline, viewers should [support]:
+ A
+ B
+ C

For maximum compatibility with viewers, manifest creators should ensure that any non-rectangular annotations are limited to the above list as well. Going beyond this list, or keeping to the SVG features contained therein but adding interaction or multiplicity of them, risks your non-rectangular annotations not appearing in a viewer. In the case of SVG non-rectangular annotations, it may not be feasible for viewers may to display only the supported features and discard the rest, as they can do for manifests more generally.

<!-- 
Gimp sets origin at upper left, uses M, C, Z, with `path` + `d`, coordinate pairs separated by commas

Acorn uses shape syntax for simple shapes, puts origin at lower left. For complex shapes, uses `path` + `d`, style elements for the stroke if there is one, commands of M, L, Z with commas between x and y in coordinate pairs.

Google Docs Drawings can be saved as SVGs, use clipPath, and separate a shape's stroke and fill into different paths. It also uses the `path` element with the `d` attribute and commands of m, l, and z, with spaces between x and y in coordinate pairs rather than commas.

## Restrictions

This approach should not be used to describe non-rotated rectangular regions.

## Example

In this Manifest, we are highlighting a fountain with a statue on top of it in GÃ¶ttingen, and imagining that we want to be fairly precise in our highlight. The client should not show the bounding box on the image.
