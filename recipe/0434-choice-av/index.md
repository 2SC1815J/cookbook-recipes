## Use Case

For an audio resource, you want to provide viewers or other software readers with multiple formats or qualities so the appropriate and/or compatible one can be presented to the listener.

## Implementation Notes

This recipe is structurally very similar to the image choice recipe, though with a different rationale and different expected outcomes. Where that recipe presented multiple images of the same object, registered against each other, audio choice emerges more frequently from uneven format compatibility in web software.

In the manifest, the central Annotation's `body` is a resource with a type of `choice`. Each resource in the `items` property is instead the media to be presented. This structure is defined in the W3C Web Annotation Data Model:

> "A 'Choice' has an ordered list of resources from which an application should select only one to process or display. The order is given from the most preferable to least preferable, according to the Annotation's creator or publisher." *â€” from [Choice Between Bodies](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/#choice-between-bodies)*

## Restrictions

No known restrictions, but not all viewers will recognize Choice.

## Example

Describe the solution in prose and provide an example.
The example json document must be an external document, and imported with the following:

{% include manifest_links.html manifest="manifest.json" %}

{% include jsonviewer.html src="manifest.json" %}

The direct link to the fixture is a useful convenience.
