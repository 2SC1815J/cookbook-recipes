### Use Case
You have a photograph of the Lacoon bronze. You would like to show the location of the bronze as a Point on a web mapping platform. This is possible using the `navPlace` property. 


### Implementation Notes
For all the information on how to use the `navPlace` property see the [implementation notes in the IIIF Extensions directory.](https://iiif.io/api/extension/navplace/#5-implementation-notes) 
For a complete guide on how to use the `navPlace` property see the [IIIF Guides entry for `navPlace`.](https://preview.iiif.io/guides/41-navPlace/guides/iiif.io.api.extension.navplace/) 


### Example
TBD - The Manifest is of an image of the Laoc√∂on bronze by Giovanni Battista Foggini, and the map shows the location of the Getty Center where it is currently displayed. 
The Manifest below contains one Canvas with a photograph painted onto it. The `navPlace` property in the Manifest stores geographic information from the photograph. `navPlace` contains GeoJSON-LD, and a client can parse GeoJSON features from `navPlace`. These GeoJSON features are rendered as geometric shapes by a web-based map platform. Often, data from the resource such as an image URL, label or summary is connected with those shapes via [`properties`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.2) in GeoJSON.  Web mapping platforms typically offer built in display functionality for metadata contained in `properties`.
