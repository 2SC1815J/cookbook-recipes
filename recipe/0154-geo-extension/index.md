summary: "Use the navPlace extension to provide geolocation information about an IIIF Presentation API 3.0 Manifest."
---

### Use Case
WIP - A Manifest contains a single Canvas item representing a photograph. Using the navPlace extension, I can specify a geographic location for the photograph that a web-based map platform can display. 


### Implementation Notes
Please refer to the [implementation notes for navPlace.](https://iiif.io/api/extension/navplace/#5-implementation-notes) 


### Example
TBD - The Manifest is of an image of the Laoc√∂on statue by Giovanni Battista Foggini, and the map shows the location of the Getty Center where it is currently displayed. 
The Manifest below contains one Canvas with a photograph painted onto it. The `navPlace` property in the Manifest stores geographic information from the photograph. `navPlace` contains GeoJSON-LD, and a client can parse GeoJSON features from `navPlace`. These GeoJSON features are rendered in geometric shapes by a web-based map platform. Often, data from the resource such as an image URL, label or description is connected with those shapes via [`properties`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.2) in GeoJSON.  Web maps typically offer built in display functionality for metadata contained in `properties`.
