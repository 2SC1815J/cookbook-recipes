### Use Case
You have multiple images of art created around the subject "Laoc√∂on". You would like to show the location of those works on a web mapping platform. Over the spread of a group of resources, consistent use of `navPlace` allows for computational addressing of geographic coordinates and arrangement of spatial representations of those resources in WGS84 coordinate space. The web mapping platforms that accomplish this offer varying degrees of interactive behavior, a portion of which are consistent between the platforms. Often, you can interchange between different projections of the surface of the Earth to find a projection that best suits your geographic data.

### Implementation Notes
For all the information on how to use the `navPlace` property see the [implementation notes in the IIIF Extensions directory.](https://iiif.io/api/extension/navplace/#5-implementation-notes) 
For a complete guide on how to use the `navPlace` property see the [IIIF Guides entry for `navPlace`.](https://preview.iiif.io/guides/41-navPlace/guides/iiif.io.api.extension.navplace/) 

### Example
The Manifest contains images of the bronze by Giovanni Battista Foggini and the painting by _______, and the map shows the locations of these works. 
The Manifest below contains two Canvases, and each Canvas has a photograph painted onto it. The `navPlace` property in the Canvases stores geographic information from the photographs. `navPlace` contains GeoJSON-LD, and a client can parse GeoJSON features from `navPlace`. These GeoJSON features are rendered as geometric shapes by a web-based map platform. Often, data from the resource such as an image URL, label or summary is connected with those shapes via [`properties`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.2) in GeoJSON.  Web mapping platforms typically offer built in display functionality for metadata contained in `properties`.
